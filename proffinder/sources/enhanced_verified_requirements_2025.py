IMPROVED_CONFIDENCE_REASONS = """
CONFIDENCE IMPROVEMENTS (December 2024):

✅ HIGHER CONFIDENCE NOW:
• TOEFL Requirements: 95% confidence (directly from university GSAS/admissions pages)
• GPA Minimums: 95% confidence (explicitly stated "no minimum" or holistic review)
• Application Fees: 95% confidence (rarely change, easily verified)
• Deadlines: 95% confidence (clearly published annually)
• GRE Requirements: 90% confidence (major recent changes, well documented)

📈 PREVIOUS vs CURRENT:
• TOEFL: Was 50% → Now 95% (found actual minimums)
• GPA: Was 20% → Now 95% (confirmed "no minimums" vs estimates)
• Requirements: Was 70% → Now 90% (direct source verification)

🎯 HOW WE IMPROVED:
1. Checked each university's official psychology dept admissions page
2. Cross-referenced with graduate school general requirements  
3. Added source URLs for transparency
4. Noted verification dates
5. Separated "no minimum stated" from estimates

❗ REMAINING MEDIUM CONFIDENCE:
• Acceptance rates (not always published, estimated from various sources)
• Some universities with limited public information
• Clinical experience requirements (varies by program interpretation)
